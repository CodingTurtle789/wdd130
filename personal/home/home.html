            <h4>What is ADHD</h4>
            <p>ADHD is a mental health diagnosis that is becoming more prevalent in our modern world.  ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. ADHD consists of two major types, one that is more centered around attention deficits and one that is centered around hyperactivity. These can be seen together or separately. Attention deficits are most commonly recognized when someone seems to have a hard time focusing on tasks. Hyperactivity is more easily identified as it is more often an outward expression of energy. These are, however, scales in severity, and vary in the presentation depending on the person.</p>

                    <h4>Treatments for ADHD</h4>
                    <p>ADHD, like all mental health diagnoses, has a number of options for treatment. However, there is one type of medication that is much more commonly used due to its higher success rate. The types of medications available fit into different categories depending on the way they react in the body. The ones that are used the vast majority of the time with ADHD are stimulants. Another common option is therapy, as it can be very beneficial to work with someone to create habits and plans to deal with the inattentiveness, the impulsiveness, and the hyperactivity so that one can better participate in the work they are required to do.</p>
