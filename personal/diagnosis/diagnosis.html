            <h4>What to Know About Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Diagnosis of ADHD is more complex than many think. There are a variety of factors that have to be considered and diagnosis is best left to a professional with expertise and experience working with ADHD. Many mental health conditions have overlapping symptoms and it is easy to misdiagnose leading to less effective treatments. Trained professionals consider multiple aspects of symptoms, life impact, and rule out other possible causes of symptoms. A diagnosis can bring understanding and awareness that helps people navigate life in more effective ways working with their brain chemistry. It also opens doors to treatments that can improve functioning and quality of life. </p>
