            <h4>Background on Gender Differences</h4>
            <p>More boys are diagnosed with ADHD than girls, 12.9% to 5.6% respectively. This may possibly be due to underdiagnosing in girls due to their symptoms being less disruptive. Girls are sometimes also misdiagnosed with other mental health problems. Boys tend to show earlier onset of symptoms than girls do so on average are diagnosed at a younger age. Symptoms can change over time and may fluctuate with hormones. More women may be diagnosed later in life. Symptoms in women can be more internally based, such as ruminating thoughts, while males may display more external symptoms such as fidgeting or disruptive behaviors. Thus the same ADHD symptom can manifest very differently between the genders due to differences in male and female brains.</p>
